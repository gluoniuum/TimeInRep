# TimeIn ⏳

this app, based on pyqt5 - activity tracker, we have many apps where we can rise goals, but not really be a program, where we can watch, how many time we spend for this or this

## Usage 🛠️

1. **Add Activities**: Create activities like hiking, coding, or any other tasks you want to track.
2. **Start Timer**: Begin the timer when you start an activity.
3. **Pomodoro Feature**: Use the Pomodoro technique to manage your time effectively.
4. **Manual Time Entry**: If you forget to start the timer, you can add time manually.
5. **Stop Timer**: You can stop the timer whenever you finish an activity.
6. **Multiple Activities**: You can start multiple activities simultaneously (unless you're Caesar or something like that! 😉).
7. **Code Quality**: You can't say it's poor code; it was my first project! 
8. **Daily Tracking**: See how much time you've spent on activities today.
9. **Persistent Data**: You can close and reopen the app, and your tracked hours will be saved.


That's all! 🎉 (i really used this for maybe 60hours, you can saw in timerss_data.json)
